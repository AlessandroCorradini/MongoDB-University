# Lab: Investigate Schema Issues

In this homework assingment we are expecting you to have the m312RS Replica Set cluster up and running in your VM. To get it started you can run the following command:

```
mlaunch init --replicaset --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB 0.3 --host localhost \
--port 30000 --oplogSize 100 --name m312RS --dir /data/m312
```

Download the handout, and add it to the VM. Initialize the database by running the following:

```
./library_db_simulator.py --init
```

This will drop the m312 database, populate its collections, and create indexes. You can run it with --help to control some of the parameters it uses.

Next, run it in the following mode:

```
./library_db_simulator.py --simulate
```

After the first batch of queries, each time you hit enter, it will simulate someone checking out a book. Your task is to determine which of the following are issues:

- **The application is triggering many more queries than are necessary for each operation.**
- The schema suffers from excessive normalization.
- The application is creating too many connections to the replica set without closing them.
