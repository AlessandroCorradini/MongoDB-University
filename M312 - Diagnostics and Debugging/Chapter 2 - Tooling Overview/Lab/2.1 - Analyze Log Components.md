# Lab: Analyze Log Components

In this lab, we are going to get you to start identifying issues with a single mongod instance.

First, we start by launching a single mongod using the configuration file single.cfg

```
mongod --config /shared/single.cfg
```

Second, you should launch a small script, that is also available with this lab handouts, called singleapp.py

```
python /shared/singleapp.py
```

Both of these steps need to be launched from within our vagrant environment m312-vagrant-env.

To be able to launch both the mongod and the python script, you need to make sure that the vagrant image has access to the handout material. To do that, you need to:

- Launch this vagrant environment (steps covered in previous lab)
- Download this lab handouts
- Copy both files ,**single.cfg** and singleapp.py, into the vagrant environment /shared folder

```
cp single.cfg m312-vagrant-env/shared
cp singleapp.py m312-vagrant-env/shared
```

- And run the previously described commands

Given this single.cfg configuration and the singleapp.py application, a few issues will be logged in the mongod log file.

Which MongoDB component is reporting these issues (enter the name in uppercase) ?

Ignore any filesystem or access control warnings!
