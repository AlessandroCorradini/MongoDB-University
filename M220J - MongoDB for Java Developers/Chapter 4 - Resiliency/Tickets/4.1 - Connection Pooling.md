# Ticket: Connection Pooling

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to modify the configuration of option that defines our maxPoolSize in the application.properties file, and set the maximum size of the connection pool to 50 connections.

By changing the properties file, the MongoClient should be configured to use no more than 50 connections. Revise the ConnectionString java class api.

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, stop the application and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

```
mvn test -Dtest=ConnectionPoolingTest
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or deploy the application from your IDE.

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

To have the application use the changes that you implemented for this ticket, make sure to restart the application after you completed those changes. Also, only refresh the status page to see the new results of the tests, after the application has been restarted.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for Connection Pooling?
