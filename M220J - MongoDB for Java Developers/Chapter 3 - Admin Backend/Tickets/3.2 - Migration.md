# Ticket: Migration

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be completing a script that performs field data type migrations. The script main class implementation is src/main/java/mflix/Migrator.java.

Things always change, and a requirement has come down that the lastupdated value in each document of the movies collection needs to be stored as an ISODate rather than a String.

Apart from the lastupdated field, we also want to clean up the different data types that currently define the field imdb.rating, where in some cases it is set as of Number type, and in other cases set as String. Given that this field represents a numeric value, this field should be set as a number in all documents.

Complete the script so it updates the values using the bulk API.

To perform the migration, run the following command:

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="mflix.Migrator"
```

or run the Migrator.java class from your IDE.

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, stop the application and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

```
mvn test -Dtest=MigrationTest
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

To have the application use the changes that you implemented for this ticket, make sure to restart the application after you completed those changes. Also, only refresh the status page to see the new results of the tests, after the application has been restarted.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for Migration?
