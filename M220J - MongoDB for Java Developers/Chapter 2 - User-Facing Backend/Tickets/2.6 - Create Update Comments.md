# Ticket: Create/Update Comments

**User Story**

"As a user, I want to be able to post comments to a movie page as well as edit my own comments."

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to implement the addComment and updateComment methods in CommentDao.

Ensure that updateComment only allows users to update their own comments, and no one else's comments.

**MFlix Functionality**

Once this ticket is completed, users will be able to post comments on their favorite (and least favorite) movies, and edit comments they've posted.

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, stop the application and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

```
mvn test -Dtest=UpdateCreateCommentTest
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Our launch the Application from your IDE.

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.
