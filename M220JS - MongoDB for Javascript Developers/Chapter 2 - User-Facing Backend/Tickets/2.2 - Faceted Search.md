# Ticket: Faceted Search

**User Story**

"As a user, I want to be able to filter cast search results by one facet, metacritic rating."

**Task**

For this Ticket, you'll be required to implement one method in db.py, get_movies_faceted, so the MFlix application can perform faceted searches.

**MFlix Functionality**

*What is a Faceted Search?*

Faceted search is a way of narrowing down search results as search parameters are added. For example, let's say MFlix allows users to filter movies by a rating from 1 to 10, but Kate Winslet has only acted in movies that have a rating of 6 or higher.

If we didn't specify any other search parameters, MFlix would allow us to choose a rating between 1 and 10. But if we first search for Kate Winslet, the application would only let us choose a rating between 6 and 10, because none of the movie documents in the result set have a rating below 6.

*Faceted Search in MFlix*

Faceted searches on the MFlix site cannot be supported with the basic search method getMovies, because that method uses the Mongo query language. For faceted searches, the application must use the Aggregation Framework.

The method facetedSearch uses the Aggregation Framework, and the individual stages in the pipeline have already been completed. Follow instructions in the moviesDAO.js file to append the required stages to the pipeline object.

**MFlix Functionality**

By default, faceted searches are not enabled. To enable faceted search in the UI, open the index.html file and replace the script block with 'window.mflix' from:

```
window.mflix={useFacets:!1}
```

and change it to:

```
mflix.useFacets = true
```

Once this change is implemented and you reload the page in the UI, the available movie search parameters will reflect the other search criteria.

**Testing and Running the Application**

Look in the facets.test.js file in your test directory to view the unit tests for this ticket.

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```
npm test -t facets
```
Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
npm start
```

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for Faceted Search?
