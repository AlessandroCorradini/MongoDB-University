# Ticket: User Management

**User Story**

"As a user, I should be able to register for an account, log in, and logout."

**Task**

For this Ticket, you'll be required to implement all the methods in usersDAO.js that are called by the API endpoints in users.controller.js. Specifically, you'll implement:

- getUser
- addUser
- loginUser
- logoutUser
- getUserSession

Registering a new user will insert a document into the users collection, and logging in a user will insert a document into the sessions collection.

There is a unique index on the user_id field in sessions, so we can efficiently query on this field.

**MFlix Functionality**

Once this ticket is completed, users will be able to register for a new account, log in, logout, and delete their account.

**Testing and Running the Application**

Look within the user-management.test.js file to view the unit tests for this ticket.

```

```

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for User Management?
