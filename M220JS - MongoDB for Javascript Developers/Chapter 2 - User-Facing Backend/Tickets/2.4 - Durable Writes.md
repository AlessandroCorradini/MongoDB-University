# Ticket: Durable Writes

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to increase the durability of the addUser method in UsersDAO.js from the default Write Concern of w: 1.

When a new user registers for MFlix, their information must be added to the database before they can do anything else on the site. For this reason, we want to make sure that the data written by the addUser method will not be rolled back in the case of a network or server error.

We can decrease the chances of a rollback by increasing the write durability of the addUser method. To use a non-default Write Concern with the insert() method, pass a new Object to the method specifying the level of Write Concern. You can read more about this in the Node.js docs.

**Testing and Running the Application**

There are no unit or integration tests for this lab.

Please complete the multiple choice question below, and then implement the correct Write Concern in the addUser method.

The implementation of this task will not be tested, but using the default of w: 1 might result in a rollback of your users' account data!



- **w: "majority"**
- w: 0
- w: 1
- **w: 2**
