# Ticket: Handling Errors

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to make the API more robust by handling exceptions. Specifically, what should happen if an incorrectly formatted _id is passed to the getMovieByID() method in moviesDAO.js?

In this case, an error will be thrown to getMovieByID() because of an invalid ID. However, the method does not need to return this error. Instead, if this error is thrown, the method should return null.

A try/catch block is already included for you in getMovieByID(). Use the variable e to figure out if the invalid ID error is being thrown, and then return null in this case.

*Hint:*

When the error e is caught, it has type Error. You might want to convert this to a string.

**Testing and Running the Application**

You can run the unit tests for this ticket by running:

```
npm test -t error-handling
```

Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

```
npm start
```

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

After passing the relevant unit tests, what is the validation code for Error Handling?
