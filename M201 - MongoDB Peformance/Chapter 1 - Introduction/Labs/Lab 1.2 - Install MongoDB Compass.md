# Lab 1.2: Install MongoDB Compass

**Problem:**

For this optional lab you're going to install the latest stable version of MongoDB Compass. This lab is optional because Compass doesn't currently support all Linux distributions.

While Compass, like MongoDB Enterprise, Compass is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced subscription it's permitted to be ran outside of production environments.

In order to install Compass you're going to need to head over to the MongoDB Download Center. From there the installation should be fairly straightforward.

Once you've successfully installed Compass answer the question below:

Did you download and install Compass?

- No, I did not.
- **Yes, I did!**
