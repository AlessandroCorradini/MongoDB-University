# Lab: Tree Patterns

In this lab, you will be selecting a variant of the Tree Pattern to improve the performance of a common set of operations for a given application.

**Scenario:**

Given your expertise in schema design, you have been called in to help improve the performance of a human resources management application called Success Factions.

This application needs to be able to map a corporate reporting structure, an organization chart, like the one this diagram represents:

![](https://university-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/M320/mongomart_org_chart.png)

Success Factions was originally designed by only taking into account the information of a single individual's data in the organization chart. Therefore, documents in the employees collection, where this data is stored, has the following schema:

```
{
  "_id": "<objectId>",
  "name": "<string>",
  "role": "<string>",
  "department": {
    "name": "<string>",
    "id": "<objectId>"
  }
}
```

**Task:**

You have been tasked to improve the schema design of the employees collection to better support the following set of operations:

- Issue one database request to find the direct manager of a given employee.
- Collect all direct reports of an employee with one single and efficient query.
- Issue one update operation to change the reporting structure of an employee.

Which of the following document notation examples and tree patterns implement all of these pieces of functionality?



- Child References
    ```
    {
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "name": "<string>",
    "role": "<string>",
    "department": {
        "name": "<string>",
        "id": "<objectId>"
    },
    "reports": [
        { "id": "<objectId>", "name": "<string>" }
    ]
    }
    ```

- **Parent References**

    ```
    {
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "name": "<string>",
    "role": "<string>",
    "department": {
        "name": "<string>",
        "id": "<objectId>"
    },
    "reports_to": {
        "id": "<objectId>",
        "name": "<string>"
    }
    }
    ```

- Array of Ancestors

    ```
    {
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "name": "<string>",
    "role": "<string>",
    "department": {
        "name": "<string>",
        "id": "<objectId>"
    },
    "reports_to": [
        { "id": "<objectId>", "name": "<string>" }
    ]
    }
    ```

- Materialized Paths

    ```
    {
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "name": "<string>",
    "role": "<string>",
    "department": {
        "name": "<string>",
        "id": "<objectId>"
    },
    "reports_to": "<string>/<string>/<string>"
    }
    ```
