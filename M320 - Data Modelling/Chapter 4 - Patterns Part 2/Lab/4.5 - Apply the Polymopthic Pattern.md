# Lab: Apply the Polymorphic Pattern

**User Story**

Our recruiting agency has just picked up a big international client named Techsy. They want us to take over their recruitment infrastructure for the foreseeable future. Techsy has various community outreach and diversity initiative programs that are focused on recruiting which have to be incorporated into our existing system.

Before working with Techsy, most of our recruiting documents looked like this:

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId("5caa9e799c0aa5e39686f803"),
  "first_name": "Arya",
  "last_name": "Stark",
  "engineer_level": 3,
  "education": [{
    "level": "BS",
    "subject": "Computer Science"
  }],
  "years_experience": 3,
  "previous_employer": "Hooli",
  "technical": ["C++", "Python", "Java", "Golang", "MongoDB", "MySQL", "Bash/Shell"],
  "non-technical": {
    "languages": ["English"],
    "other": ["fencing", "dance", "horseback riding", "management"]
  },
  "candidate_notes": "A fierce warrior and survivor. Will do amazingly on any team."
}
```

The following two documents are additional types of documents we are now getting from the Techsy team:

```
[{
  "_id": ObjectId("5caa9e819c0aa5e39686f804"),
  "first_name": "Ginevra",
  "last_name": "Weasley",
  "program_affiliation": "Veteran Outreach Apprenticeship",
  "team_placement": "Server",
  "start_date": ISODate("2017-01-31T00:00:00.000Z"),
  "end_date": ISODate("2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z"),
  "education": "App Bootcamp",
  "extend_offer": "yes",
  "technical_skills": ["JS", "ReactJS", "NodeJS", "bash/shell", "HTML5", "CSS", "Ruby on Rails", "Python"],
  "non-technical_skills": {
    "languages": ["English"],
    "other": ["Magic"]
  },
  "notes": "Ginny has been an amazing part of the team during the apprenticeship and we would love to extend her an offer to join us more permanently."
}, {
  "_id": ObjectId("5caa9e899c0aa5e39686f805"),
  "name": {
    "first": "Rincewind",
    "last": "TheWizzard"
  },
  "program_affiliation": "Techsy Summer Internship ",
  "team_placement": "Data Optimization",
  "start_date": ISODate("2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
  "end_date": ISODate("2019-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"),
  "education": [{
      "level": "BA Major",
      "subject": "Philosophy"
    },
    {
      "level": "BS Minor",
      "subject": "Artificial Intelligence"
    }
  ],
  "extend_offer": "yes",
  "skills": {
    "technical": ["R", "Django", "JavaScript", "Matlab", "HTML5", "CSS", "Mathematica", "LaTeX", "Java", "JIRA"],
    "languages": ["English", "Chimeran", "Vanglemesht", "Sumtri", "Black Oroogu", "High Borogravian", "beTrobi"],
    "other": []
  },
  "notes": "Rinecewind has great ideas, but he is a bit of a mess. We still like him a lot and would love to keep him on board."
}]
```

Our recruiters need to be able to search all the candidates available in the system, meaning that we have to add the Techsy records into our candidates collection. After adding their records, we will need to be able to differentiate between the different document shapes.

**Task**

We've decided that the name format for all the varying document shapes can be structured as two separate fields: first_name and last_name. However, the rest of the differences are not that easy to consolidate.

To address this, we will use the Polymorphic Pattern to identify the shape of each document depending on which recruiting source it came from. We will make the following modifications to our current schemas:

- Across all documents, we will use two fields for name: first_name and last_name.
- Across all documents, we will use a field called recruiting_source as the indicative field for the document shape.
- In documents that already have an existing program_affiliation field, we will use the value of this field as the recruiting_source.
- In documents that don't have program_affiliation, we will add a new field called recruiting_source.
- All documents should indicate whether an offer was extended via the extend_offer field.

To complete this task, complete the following steps:

- Modify the following schemas to incorporate the previously-stated changes:

    ```
    [{
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "first_name": "<string>",
    "last_name": "<string>",
    "engineer_level": "<int>",
    "education": [{
        "level": "<string>",
        "subject": "<string>"
    }],
    "years_experience": "<int>",
    "previous_employer": "<string>",
    "technical": ["<string>"],
    "non-technical": {
        "languages": ["<string>"],
        "other": ["<string>"]
    },
    "candidate_notes": "<string>"
    }, {
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "first_name": "<string>",
    "last_name": "<string>",
    "program_affiliation": "<string>",
    "team_placement": "<string>",
    "start_date": "<date>",
    "end_date": "<date>",
    "education": "<string>",
    "extend_offer": "<string>",
    "technical_skills": ["<string>"],
    "non-technical_skills": {
        "languages": ["<string>"],
        "other": ["<string>"]
    },
    "notes": "<string>"
    }, {
    "_id": "<objectId>",
    "name": {
        "first": "<string>",
        "last": "<string>"
    },
    "program_affiliation": "<string>",
    "team_placement": "<string>",
    "start_date": "<date>",
    "end_date": "<date>",
    "education": [{
        "level": "<string>",
        "subject": "<string>"
        },
        {
        "level": "<string>",
        "subject": "<string>"
        }
    ],
    "extend_offer": "<string>",
    "skills": {
        "technical": ["<string>"],
        "languages": ["<string>"],
        "other": ["<string>"]
    },
    "notes": "<string>"
    }]
    ```

- Save the updated schemas to a file named pattern_polymorphic.json, with each schema definition separated by a comma and the full solution enclosed in array brackets.

- Validate your answer on Windows by running:

    ```
    validate_m320 pattern_polymorphic --file pattern_polymorphic.json
    ```

- Validate your answer on MacOS and Linux by running:

    ```
    ./validate_m320 pattern_polymorphic --file pattern_polymorphic.json
    ```

After running this script, you will either be given a validation code or an error message indicating what might be missing in your file.

When you get the validation code, paste it in the text box below and click submit.
