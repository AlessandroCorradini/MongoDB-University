# Final Exam: Question 9

**Scenario**

You work as a developer at a factory. Your factory wants to track the usage statistics of the automatic lighting that was recently installed throughout its facilities. The lights send an update to the database every 10 seconds, but the management is interested in an hourly report instead. Additionally, we are only looking to store this information for at most 5 years, so an easy way to purge old data would be beneficial to our data modeling approach.

Which pattern solution is best suited for this situation?



- The Computed Pattern
- The Polymorphic Pattern
- **The Bucket Pattern**
- The Subset Pattern
- The Extended Reference Pattern
