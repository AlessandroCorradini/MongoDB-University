# Final Exam: Question 12

**Scenario**

As a chemical manufacturer, you tend to keep your factory and your data organized, since dealing with chemicals requires a lot of precision, attention, and safety mechanisms. One of the safety mechanisms in the factory is the documentation about produced chemicals. This documentation is recorded in Material Safety Data Sheets which are large pdf documents containing safety details about a given chemical. These Data Sheets are part of the documents in the inventory collection, where other information such as the price, quantity, and warehouse location of the chemical is stored as well.

Keeping track of production, sales, and purchases requires a lot of data manipulation on an hourly basis. You notice that at especially busy times, your inventory tracking application slows down by a lot.
