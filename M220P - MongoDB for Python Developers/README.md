# M220P: MongoDB for Python Developers

## What You'll Learn

This course will teach you how to use MongoDB as the database for a Python application.

You'll play the role of a back-end developer for a Python application, and your job is to implement the application's communication with MongoDB. This includes:

- Reading and writing data
- Using the Aggregation Framework
- Managing the configuration of the database client through the Python driver
- Creating a robust application by handling exceptions and timeouts

**Prerequisites:**

We highly recommend taking M001 prior to taking this course. A basic understanding of MongoDB's document model will help you get the most out of this course.

## What You'll Build

You'll build the back-end for a movie-browsing application called MFlix.

Using the Pymongo driver for Python, you will implement MFlix's basic functionality. This includes basic and complex movie searches, registering new users, and posting comments on the site.

You will also add more features to the MFlix application. This includes writing analytical reports, increasing the durability of MFlix's connection with MongoDB, and implementing security best practices.
